## Why not Numbers?

***

In 1973, Francis Anscombe constructed a dataset with four series. These four arrays of x/y pairs have:

 * The same mean in both X and Y
 * The same variance in both X and Y
 * A high coefficient of correlation 
 * The same regression line

These sets should be essentially the same, right?
